GNOME Applet Frontend for xvnkb (and unikey maybe) and a docklet.

After installing, you will get an "Vietnamese Keyboard" applet in Utility (if you have gnome) and vnkb-docklet, which is a docklet.

Features:
	- Change the appearance of applet (font,color,label)
	- Support both unikey and xvnkb
	- A docklet for people not using Gnome.
